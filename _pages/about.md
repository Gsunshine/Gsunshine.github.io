Hi! I am a research assistant at [ZERO Lab](https://zero-lab-pku.github.io/), School of EECS, Peking University, working with Prof. [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/).

**I am actively looking for Ph.D. position this year!**

Research
---------

I have broad interests in machine learning and deep learning, especially the dynamics in deep learning and the dynamics of deep learning. I believe that structural decomposition, i.e., disentanglement, is a key to understanding the emergence of intelligence, while it can be elegantly formulated and achieved by the dynamics.

- For the dynamics in deep learning, I study differentiable programming, nested optimization, and implicit models as the construction principle in neural networks.
  - This is the "forward" pass.
- For the dynamics of deep learning, I try to understand the training dynamics of neural networks and their loss landscape, especially the gradient issue when the networks are constructed by the dynamics in deep learning.
  - This is the "backward" pass.

I also have strong interests in AI for sciences, especially genetics.
