Hi! I'm a CS Ph.D. student at CMU, advised by [J. Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/). Previously, I was a research assistant at Peking University, advised by [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/). I am an enthusiast of delicate structures, recognizing and developing structures that self organizes complex systems. Here is my [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dggtmczgrysp). (Welcome to use this template!)

Research
---------

I have eclectic interests in machine learning and deep learning, especially the dynamics in deep learning and the dynamics of deep learning. I believe that structured decomposition, i.e., disentanglement, is a key to understanding the emergence of intelligence, while it can be elegantly formulated and achieved by the dynamics.

- For the dynamics in deep learning, I study differentiable programming, nested optimization, and fixed point system as the construction principle in neural networks.
  - This is the "forward" pass.
- For the dynamics of deep learning, I try to understand the training dynamics of neural networks. I am fascinated by their landscape. A strong perception drives me to believe that many problems in model design can be attributed to training.
  - This is the "backward" pass.

I am also interested in developing principled learning methods for scientific problems through the structures.
